# How to Contribute

Hey there! I'm glad that you're poking around, and perhaps interested in
helping me to improve my website. I really appreciate it. :tada:

## Contributing via GitHub

### Background

For a quick summary of technologies used, see the [README][tech-used].

Here are the quick and dirty details that you should know about how we
work.

* For managing events, edit this file:
  [`_data/events.yml`](_data/events.yml)
* We share push access liberally. (Just [open an issue][new-issue] and ask!)
* `master` branch is automatically deployed to our live website.
* `master` branch is protected, and so can't be pushed to directly.
* All changes are made through pull requests.

### Step-by-Step

Here are the general steps that we recommend you follow to get your
improvements onto the website:

1. **Before doing any work, open a new issue** to discuss your idea.
   This helps ensure that our visions align.
2. Ask for push access. (I'll give it to you!)
    * I use branch protection on `master`, so you can't push there.
3. **Create a "topic branch"** in the main repo, describing your change. eg.
   `my-special-feature`.
4. Make some commits.
5. As early as you'd like, **create a "pull request"** for your branch into
   `master`.
    * If your branch is in the main repo, you'll notice that a review app
      will deployed with your code, and linked in the issue. This will
      help us collaborate more smoothly.
6. When you think your changes are ready, post a pull request comment to
   say so, and **ask for a review**.
7. **I'll review your changes** with the help of the Review App. Then I'll either:
    1. merge them right away, or
    2. ask you to make some changes.
        - Don't worry! This is totally no big deal! Working together to get
          things just right is a common dynamic in working openly.
8. After coming to agreement on the best possible contribution, **I'll
   merge your changes** into `master`!
9. Your changes are now live on the website. Yay! Thanks a bunch!
